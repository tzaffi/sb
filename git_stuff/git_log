To see only the commits of a certain author:

`git log --author=bob`

To see a very compressed log where each commit is one line:

`git log --pretty=oneline`

Or maybe you want to see an ASCII art tree of all the branches, decorated with the names of tags and branches:
`git log --graph --oneline --decorate --all`

See only which files have changed:
`git log --name-status`

These are just a few of the possible parameters you can use.
For more, see:
`git log --help`
