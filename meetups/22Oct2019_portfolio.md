## Standing out - Hard to differentiation

"Perception starts with the eye" - Aristotle


1. Stay relevant - 6 seconds to state your "Hero": who you are and what you do
2. Quality over quantity - cherry pick and show the best of the best
3. Solid and clear story - 
4. [Obsess over design] - live/eat/sleep it
5. Find places to inject personality - images/text - brand and make memorable
