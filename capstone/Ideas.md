## Fraud Detection Kaggle Competition

An approachable Kaggle competition created by the IEEE with a wonderful starter notebook.

## Hyperbolic Attention Networks

DeepMind work on imposing hyperbolic geometry on the activations of neural networks with
applications to machine translation, learning on graphs, and visual question answering tasks.

## Post-earnings Stock Price Predictor

Apply Causal Discovery with Attention-Based Convolutional Neural Networks to find causal
relationships between time-series data and predict price movements after earnings announcements.

## Mathematical Reasoning
A 2019 ICLR paper presented by DeepMind provided a dataset with 2,000,000 instances.
A great paper that I can try to reproduce and productionize, though is practicality is non-obvious.

## Automated Theorem Proving

Work by Google research. Chollet's data set (Holstep) is easier to work with than
the more recent Szegedy data set (Holist). Third link below to a clever idea of
viewing expressions as graphs and then embedding these as feature vectors. I'm not sure
how practical this is.

## Automatic Code Generation

Generating programs from input-output pairs.
It doesn't look like there is any pipeline associated.
So providing a data pipeline and an API in front of it might be a good project.
Downside is that the generated code is in an artificial DSL, so not immediately pracical.
