# Docker Compose Essentials

Inside of docker/docker-for-data-science/talkvoter

## A. basics of docker-compose

docker-compose build
docker-compose up

# combine both above with:
docker-compose up --build -d

docker-compose ps
docker ps

# restart a service:
docker-compose restart app

# stop everything
docker-compose stop
docker-compose ps

# bring back up (without rebuilding):
docker-compose start
docker-compose ps # shows exited containers

# destroy everything
docker-compose down
docker-compose ps # shows nothing

## B. Expose a port

added a `docker-compose.override.yml` exposing 8000 -> 8000

ran `docker-compose up` and was able to reach login page of application

## C. Exec v. Run

# did
docker-compose exec app /bin/bash
docker-compose run  app /bin/bash
	       ^^^^

and then created a file.
For exec it persisted. For run it didn't. Also could not see file created in
exec in run.

## D. Second node and intereact

Connected to app and was able to ping the db with `ping db` - that was COOL!!!

Then installed a `psql` client and was able to connect as well.

For more details see here: https://github.com/docker-for-data-science/docker-for-data-science-tutorial/tree/master/exercises/05_docker_compose_essentials#exercise-d-add-a-second-node-and-interact

## E. My own extra exercises. I want to actually see how the notebook is running

docker-compose --build -d

# couldn't log into app at 8000 so tailed logs with:
docker-compose logs -f app

# so really had to issue some commands as exemplified in ./Makefile:
docker-compose exec app flask db upgrade --directory ./talkvoter/migrations/
username=myuser password=insecure make superuser
